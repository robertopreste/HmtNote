Human mitochondrial variants annotation using HmtVar.


* Free software: MIT license
* Documentation: https://hmtnote.readthedocs.io.


Features
--------

HmtNote is a bioinformatics tool that can be used to annotate human mitochondrial variants from a VCF, using data available on HmtVar_.

Annotations are grouped into basic, cross-reference, variability and predictions, depending on the type of information they provide.

Basic
=====

Basic information about the variant; they include:

* Locus: Locus to which the variant belongs
* AaChange: Aminoacidic change determined
* Pathogenicity: Pathogenicity predicted by HmtVar
* Disease Score: Disease score calculated by HmtVar

Cross-reference
===============

Cross-reference information about the variant; they include:

* Clinvar: Clinvar_ ID of the variant
* dbSNP: dbSNP_ ID of the variant
* OMIM: OMIM_ ID of the variant
* MitomapAssociatedDiseases: Diseases associated to the variant according to Mitomap_
* MitomapSomaticMutations: Diseases associated to the variant according to `Mitomap Somatic Mutations`_

Variability
===========

Variability and allele frequency data about the variant; they include:

* NtVarH: Nucleotide variability of the position in healthy individuals
* NtVarP: Nucleotide variability of the position in patient individuals
* AaVarH: Aminoacid variability of the position in healthy individuals
* AaVarP: Aminoacid variability of the position in patient individuals
* AlleleFreqH: Allele frequency of the variant in healthy individuals overall
* AlleleFreqP: Allele frequency of the variant in patient individuals overall
* AlleleFreqH_AF: Allele frequency of the variant in healthy individuals from Africa
* AlleleFreqP_AF: Allele frequency of the variant in patient individuals from Africa
* AlleleFreqH_AM: Allele frequency of the variant in healthy individuals from America
* AlleleFreqP_AM: Allele frequency of the variant in patient individuals from America
* AlleleFreqH_AS: Allele frequency of the variant in healthy individuals from Asia
* AlleleFreqP_AS: Allele frequency of the variant in patient individuals from Asia
* AlleleFreqH_EU: Allele frequency of the variant in healthy individuals from Europe
* AlleleFreqP_EU: Allele frequency of the variant in patient individuals from Europe
* AlleleFreqH_OC: Allele frequency of the variant in healthy individuals from Oceania
* AlleleFreqP_OC: Allele frequency of the variant in patient individuals from Oceania

Predictions
===========

Pathogenicity prediction information of the variant from external resources; they include:

* MutPred_Prediction: Pathogenicity prediction offered by MutPred_
* MutPred_Probability: Confidence of the pathogenicity prediction offered by MutPred_
* Panther_Prediction: Pathogenicity prediction offered by Panther_
* Panther_Probability: Confidence of the pathogenicity prediction offered by Panther_
* PhDSNP_Prediction: Pathogenicity prediction offered by `PhD SNP`_
* PhDSNP_Probability: Confidence of the pathogenicity prediction offered by `PhD SNP`_
* SNPsGO_Prediction: Pathogenicity prediction offered by `SNPs & GO`_
* SNPsGO_Probability: Confidence of the pathogenicity prediction offered by `SNPs & GO`_
* Polyphen2HumDiv_Prediction: Pathogenicity prediction offered by Polyphen2_ HumDiv
* Polyphen2HumDiv_Probability: Confidence of the pathogenicity prediction offered by Polyphen2_ HumDiv
* Polyphen2HumVar_Prediction: Pathogenicity prediction offered by Polyphen2_ HumVar
* Polyphen2HumVar_Probability: Confidence of the pathogenicity prediction offered by Polyphen2_ HumVar

Usage
-----

Command Line Interface
======================

HmtNote can be used as a command line tool, by simply providing the original VCF and the filename where the annotated VCF will be saved::

    hmtnote input_vcf.vcf annotated_vcf.vcf

By default, HmtNote will annotate the VCF using all four groups of annotations (basic, cross-reference, variability and predictions). If desired, you can specify which kind of annotation you want, using respectively ``--basic``, ``--crossref``, ``--variab`` and ``--predict``::

    hmtnote input_vcf.vcf annotated_basic_vcf.vcf --basic
    hmtnote input_vcf.vcf annotated_crossreferences_vcf.vcf --crossref
    hmtnote input_vcf.vcf annotated_variability_vcf.vcf --variability
    hmtnote input_vcf.vcf annotated_predictions_vcf.vcf --predict

Python Module
=============

HmtNote can also be imported in a Python script and its function ``annotate_vcf()`` can be used to annotated a given VCF::

    from hmtnote import annotate_vcf
    annotate_vcf("input_vcf.vcf", "annotated_vcf.vcf")

By default, ``annotate_vcf()`` will annotate the VCF using all four groups of annotations (basic, cross-reference, variability and predictions). If desired, you can specify which kind of annotation you want, using respectively the ``basic=True``, ``crossref=True``, ``variab=True``, ``predict=True`` arguments::

    annotate_vcf("input_vcf.vcf", "annotated_basic_vcf.vcf", basic=True)
    annotate_vcf("input_vcf.vcf", "annotated_crossreferences_vcf.vcf", crossref=True)
    annotate_vcf("input_vcf.vcf", "annotated_variability_vcf.vcf", variab=True)
    annotate_vcf("input_vcf.vcf", "annotated_predictions_vcf.vcf", predict=True)

Installation
------------

HmtNote can be installed using ``pip``:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install hmtnote

If you have issues, please refer to the Installation section of the Documentation_.
