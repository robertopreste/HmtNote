Command Line Interface
======================

HmtNote can be used as a command line tool, using the ``annotate`` command and providing the input VCF file name and the file name or path where the annotated VCF will be saved::

    hmtnote annotate input.vcf annotated.vcf

By default, HmtNote will annotate the VCF file using all four groups of annotations (basic, cross-reference, variability and predictions). If desired, you can select which specific annotation you want, using respectively ``--basic``, ``--crossref``, ``--variab`` and ``--predict`` (or ``-b``, ``-c``, ``-v``, ``-p``), or any combination of these options::

    hmtnote annotate input.vcf annotated_basic.vcf --basic
    hmtnote annotate input.vcf annotated_crossreferences.vcf --crossref
    hmtnote annotate input.vcf annotated_variability.vcf --variab
    hmtnote annotate input.vcf annotated_predictions.vcf --predict
    hmtnote annotate input.vcf annotate_basic_variability.vcf --basic --variab

It is also possible to convert the resulting annotated VCF file to CSV format, for a simpler visual inspection of the data, by simply specifying the ``--csv`` option **(please note that an output VCF file name must be provided)**::

    hmtnote annotate input.vcf annotated.vcf --csv

An additional ``annotated.csv`` file will be created in the same directory of ``annotated.vcf``.

By default, HmtNote works by pulling the required data from HmtVar_ on the fly, but if you're planning to annotate VCF files offline, first download the annotation database using the ``dump`` command::

    hmtnote dump

After that, HmtNote is capable of working even when no internet connection is available; this can be achieved using the ``--offline`` option after the usual annotation command::

    hmtnote annotate input.vcf annotated.vcf --offline
    hmtnote annotate input.vcf annotated_variability.vcf --variab --offline

HmtNote will look for data in the dumped database, which was saved as ``hmtnote_dump.pkl``, to perform annotations.
**PLEASE NOTE: when working in *online mode*, HmtNote will retrieve from HmtVar only those entries that correspond to variants contained in the input VCF file; the ``dump`` command, instead, downloads the entire HmtVar database (actually just the subset used by HmtNote) to the local disk.** Although this local database is not bigger than a few dozen MB, the download process may take a while.

**PLEASE NOTE: data in HmtVar is subject to frequent updates, so please remember to run ``hmtnote dump`` as frequently as possible to be sure you're working with the latest data.** Use the *offline mode* at your own risk.

Python Module
=============

HmtNote can also be imported in a Python script and its function ``annotate_vcf()`` can be used to annotate a given VCF::

    from hmtnote import annotate_vcf
    annotate("input.vcf", "annotated.vcf")

By default, ``annotate_vcf()`` will annotate the VCF using all four groups of annotations (basic, cross-reference, variability and predictions). If desired, you can specify which kind of annotation you want, using respectively the ``basic=True``, ``crossref=True``, ``variab=True``, ``predict=True`` arguments, or any combination of them::

    annotate("input.vcf", "annotated_basic.vcf", basic=True)
    annotate("input.vcf", "annotated_crossreferences.vcf", crossref=True)
    annotate("input.vcf", "annotated_variability.vcf", variab=True)
    annotate("input.vcf", "annotated_predictions.vcf", predict=True)
    annotate("input.vcf", "annotate_basic_variability.vcf", basic=True, variab=True)

An additional annotated CSV can be produced from the output VCF using the ``csv=True`` argument::

    annotate("input.vcf", "annotated.vcf", csv=True)

If you want to work offline, HmtNote offers an *offline mode*, that will download the annotation database so that it can be used when no internet connection is available. The ``dump()`` function allows to download the local HmtNote database::

    from hmtnote import dump
    dump()

Now it is possible to perform offline annotation of VCF files, by simply adding the ``offline=True`` argument to the usual annotation function::

    annotate("input.vcf", "annotated.vcf", offline=True)
    annotate("input.vcf", "annotated_variability.vcf, variab=True, offline=True)

Please read above for potential limitations of the *offline mode*.
